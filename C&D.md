# C&D - Connect and download

## How
C&D works by utilizing a serial connection between the client computer and sending a file through a pipe, by doing this instead of attempting to type programs,  they can be both scripts and compiled prgrams, and be much larger without losing time. This allowed for complex-ish programs to be inserted into a client with minimal access time.

## Important Components
- Arduino Leonardo or clone
- SD card reader
