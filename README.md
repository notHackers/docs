# Remote IT

Remote IT is a series of solutions for modern problems
**This project is only meant for memes and jokes, and is not meant for any malicious activities. We take no legal responsibility for any damage caused by them.**

## Why
Remote IT was developed as a project for a grade 12 computer science class by two guys.
The first concepts was a way to access computers without having control of computer ports and/or port forwarding, but as time went on, it became a full solution with both hardware and software involved

## How
Remote IT consists of two parts:
- C&D - A series of arduino programs and a sick piece of hardware to download things
- ROT - Remote operating toaster

### C&D
C&D is a solution to a surprising amount of 'problems'

### ROT
ROT is a set of 3 1/2 progams:
- Frontend - A react app built to  view things nicely, it kinda sucks, I'm not a frontend dev
- Server - A HTTP REST server that handles things, actually, everything
- Installer/Client :
	- The installer installs the client
	- The client connects to the server through REST requests
